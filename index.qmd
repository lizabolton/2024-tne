# Kia ora koutou 欢迎大家

::: notes
Kia ora koutou ko Liza taku ingoa, Huānyíng dàjiā, wǒ de míngzì shì Liza

I am a professional teaching fellow in the Department of Statistics and
in May this year I was at Southwest University for three weeks teaching
a stage three data science practice course.

::: notes
I wanted to start this by saying I had a really amazing time! Not only
only did I eat a lot of good food and get to see some pandas, but I
think the experience has improved my teaching practices especially with
respect to supporting English Language Learners.

## My experience

A focus on the **individual** knowing the right people and asking the
right questions. For me this created a lot of pressure to try to think
of all the thing I might need to ask about, or else it be *my fault* for
not knowing.

...and there are still things I am embarrassed that I don't know.

# Suggestions

## Sign-on check-in

What do people need to know to agree to this and when do they need to
know it

📆 Dates ♿️ Accessibility considerations 🌈🌏 Identity considerations

## Orientation

::: incremental
-   Who does what and who can you ask about what
-   Visa information
-   Travel advice (SafeTravel, vaccinations, etc.)
-   Relevant University policies
-   Cultural competency
-   How the programme works
-   Expectations
    -   Pre-arrival videos or not, assessment, exam versions
    -   Communicating with your co-teacher
    -   Scheduling, e.g., holiday shifted dates / public holidays in NZ
-   Opportunity to meet others who have been to the same place / are
    going to be in the same place

## Reflection and feedback gathering

-   A more systemic way gather and share post-teaching reflections or
    information that can then actually be used to iterate on the
    information and support provided
-   Thanks for having me here today! I also have a write up of my time at SWU and advice for other folks linked [here](https://github.com/lizabolton/2024-tne/blob/main/For%20future%20China%20teaching.pdf).
